  <h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <p> The player can use his or her Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may select a maneuver for his or her Pokémon to fight using one of four moves, use an item, switch his or her active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain number of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon will level up. A Pokémon's level controls its physical properties, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves it has learned.

This concept of trading information was new to the video gaming industry because previously connection cables were only being used for competition. <a href="#toc"> Go back </a> </p>

  <p> The music was composed by Junichi Masuda[51] on a Commodore Amiga computer, which only features PCM sample playback, and converted to the Game Boy with a program he had written.[52]

The audio of Red and Blue consists entirely of game music and sound effects; all dialogue is on-screen.

  <p> The success of these games has been attributed to their innovative gaming experience rather than audiovisual effects. Papers published by the Columbia Business School indicate both American and Japanese children prefer the actual gameplay of a game over special audio or visual effects. In Pokémon games, the lack of these artificial effects has actually been said to promote the child's imagination and creativity. <a href="#toc"> Go back </a> </p>
