  <h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <p> The game is played by one or more players, locally or online, using their car to hit a soccer ball, which is much larger than the cars themselves, into the opposing goal. Each goal is worth one point, and the team with the most points when 5 minutes have passed wins. If both teams are tied when the timer runs out, the game enters the sudden death overtime mode, which lasts indefinitely until either team scores.

  <p> There are also many various mini-games and tournaments only available in single player, consisting of situations such as the player being outnumbered by computer-controlled opponents, or objectives such as shooting balls at a goal in a certain amount of time or defending a goal from shots from a cannon. For each completed mini-game or tournament, the player can earn up to 5 stars, depending on how well it was completed, along with various criteria depending on the game in question. <a href="#toc"> Go back </a> </p>
